This GitHub repository, `FactorioProductionCalculator`, is a new Vue.js web application designed to help Factorio players. While it has a basic setup with a README and .gitignore, it currently lacks many best practices essential for an open-source project that aims for reliability, maintainability, and community engagement.

The fact that the "Updated" date is in the future (2025-08-28) is unusual and could be a data anomaly. However, it strongly suggests the project is actively being developed. The following checklist prioritizes items that will have the most immediate impact on the project's foundational quality, trustworthiness, and potential for growth.
